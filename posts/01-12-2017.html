        <p>
          I haven't posted any other topics since I launched my site, but that's because I was busy making sure I did well in school so I can shine even more on here. I'm going to try and keep up a montly update system on the blog to keep track of what I've been up to, both in and out of school.
          <br/><br/>
          Inside of school I'm starting my CS252 Systems Programming course, and outside of school I'm trying to decide what my next project will be. I am making a list of things I think would be cool and will rank them in an order I'd like to complete them in. I'm still fond of the idea of a cloud based receipt storage system, but I'm weighing my options. I should have it figured out by next month!
          <br/><br/>
          I'm also trying to find ways to improve my site; I've added my LinkedIn profile link on the <a href="/#contact-section">homepage</a>, and I'm working on some scheme tweaks, as well as polishing the blog section. Hopefully it turns out well!
