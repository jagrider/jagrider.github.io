        <h2>Updates & New Beginnings</h2>

        <p>
          This month I have been learning more about multi-threaded programming
          techniques and parsing HTTP requests. Our last lab for CS252 involves
          the idea that we are making a "Gladiator" to fight with other programs.
          The objective is to create the fastest solution that will fork processes
          and kill enemy processes. After grading concludes, they will take the top
          submissions and hold a tournament for extra credit -- May the best program win!
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of coursework, I've been working with my partners to try and
          fine tune the search results from the diff-prez project. Whether that
          will see the light of day by the end of the school year is yet to be
          seen, however. I've also began the process of desiging the UI for a
          Scheduling application, but I am still working on what platform and
          language to write it in. I am considering putting some effort into
          learning more about Objective-C and Swift after the semester ends, as
          it could prove worthwhile in any future projects I decide to take
          part in.
