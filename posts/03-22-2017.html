        <p>
          Since I didn't make a post in February due to some heavy courseloads,
          I decided that this month I'd include what I've been up to since my last post.
        </p>
        <h2>February</h2>
        <p>
          Late at the end of January and into early February, two of my friends
          and myself participated in the Boilermake IV hackathon. What came out
          of thise coding-packed weekend was a webapp that will crawl through
          President Obama's WhiteHouse.gov and President Trump's WhiteHouse.gov
          and compare the differences between the two, hoping to show the
          different policy positions that each President took/has taken thus
          far.
        </p>
        <p>
          We call this project Diff-Prez, and you can check out our progress via
          our public repository
           <a href="http://www.github.com/mashbeck/diff-prez">here.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to Diff-Prez, I spend a good amount of my time this month
          working on a projcect for my Systems Programming course, in which we
          used Lex and Yacc to make an interpreter for a scripting language
          that my professor created. We also created our own parsing grammar,
          added bracketed lists, and gave it the ability to define any extra
          functions that the user may need.
        </p>
        <p>
          And last but not least, I have accepted an internship offer with
          ECS Solutions, a batch-automation company located in Evansville, IN.
          I am extremely excited to work for them this upcoming summer and gain
          invaluable industry experience!
        </p>
        <h2>March</h2>
        <p>
          The month of March is still unraveling itself, but that hasn't kept
          me from staying busy. This month a majority of my time has been
          devoted to the Shell Project, a decade old project in my Systems
          Programming course that has been quite the challenge. We were to
          create a functioning terminal shell for UNIX machines, complete with
          extra features like Wildcarding, command history, environment
          variables, and much more.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once I have completed my coursework at
          Purdue, I will be sure to upload it as well as my other computer
          science coursework to my GitHub so that I may keep a public
          record of what I have worked on over the years.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to the Shell, I am beginning to work on the ideas
          behind a small project for iOS and/or macOS. I want to make a
          application that allows for each course schedule planning for
          High School/University courses. This could allow them to plan
          their days/weeks in a timetable, along with information like
          the course name, course numbers, instructors, and more.
        </p>
