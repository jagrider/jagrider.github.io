            SimplePass is desiged to be a secure, no strings attached password
		generator for moblie platforms. There are 5 "types" of passwords
		implemented, and these types have their own custom toggles for length and
		character controlling to get that perfect password every time. Passwords
		are generated on the fly, and there is no data storage; the only passwords
		active are those that are displayed on the screen. Each time a new set is
		generated, the old set is completely lost. <br><br> I created SimplePass
		for one sole purpose: Password generation when you need it. I am currently
		planning an Android release soon, with an iOS version about to go under
		development. I did not intend this application to be the next big thing,
		rather to give people a free, safe alternative to online password makers.
		In addition, this is the first mobile application I have made and I thought
		it would be a relatively easy way for me to become familiar with
		application development.<br><br> I will be releasing SimplePass in the
		coming weeks. It will be available on the Play Store, as well as for
		download on this site.

            I have done some work on an enterprise application for a local
            company which desired to access, terminate and update their
            work orders remotely. Among several key features, clients would be
            able to create a work order that management could send to the
            appropriate employee. Employees would update the job with the
            appropriate status, be able to create a schedule with the client
            and access tools from nearby job sites should an issue arise.
            <br><br>
            The project was halted midway through due to issues outside of
            the development process. It is, in its current state, incomplete
            and has been put on hold indefinitely. If you are interested
            in this type of applicaiton framework, please feel free to
            contact me and mention the project.
