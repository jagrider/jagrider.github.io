	<h2>SimplePass</h2>
	<p>SimplePass is desiged to be a secure, no strings attached password generator for moblie platforms. There are 5 "types" of passwords implemented, and these types have their own custom toggles for length and character controlling to get that perfect password every time. Passwords are generated on the fly, and there is no data storage; the only passwords active are those that are displayed on the screen. Each time a new set is generated, the old set is completely lost. <br><br> I created SimplePass for one sole purpose: Password generation when you need it. I am currently planning an Android release soon, with an iOS version about to go under development. I did not intend this application to be the next big thing, rather to give people a free, safe alternative to online password makers. In addition, this is the first mobile application I have made and I thought it would be a relatively easy way for me to become familiar with application development.<br><br> I will be releasing SimplePass to the Android store in the coming weeks. It will be available on the Play Store, as well as for download on this site.</p>
	
	<!-- removed text:
		 I used to code my own generator whenever I changed my passwords because I was paranoid about some other generator saving my data. After making several versions and tweaks to it, I thought why not let anyone use it? Thus this application was born.
