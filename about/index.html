    I'm a student at Purdue University pursuing a Bachelor of
    Science in Computer Science. I am currently in my second
    year of CS at Purdue. Computers have always been of great
    interest to me, and I love playing with the latest and greatest tech. I'm
    a very goal oriented person with the desire to get things done.

  <h2>Programming Background</h2>
  <h3>Coding</h3>
  <p>
    While my high school didn't have programming classes, I did learn some
    programming skills before coming to college. I learned the basics of Java
    and C++ on my own, and have expanded on that knowledge since arriving. I am
    now proficient in Java, C and I have experience with Android Development,
    C++ and HTML.
  </p>
  <h3>Relevant Experiences</h3>
  <p>
    I have completed coursework involving the foundations of Computer Science,
    object and non-object oriented programming. I am currently an
    Undergraduate Teaching Assistant for CS180 as well as a mentor in the
    Peer-2-Peer mentor program. I am also working on side projects, and I am
    updating them on this site accordingly. You may read about them on my
    <a href="/projects">Projects page</a>
