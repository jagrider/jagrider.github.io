I've finally got around to creating my own "website" of sorts. As of right now, I'm using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) for the structure and Markdown for my posts here. Making the site was much easier than I thought, although it is a work in progress. I will use the site to share my open works and updates to progress on my personal projects.
