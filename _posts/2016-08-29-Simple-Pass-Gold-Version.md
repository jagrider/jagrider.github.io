After a few weeks of testing, UI tweaks and additions, I believe I've compiled the Gold version of SimplePass 1.0. This will be my first applicaiton for mobile devices, more specifically for Android. I am in the process of creating the iOS equivelant, but for now I am focused on releasing SimplePass to the Google Play Store, for anyone to download and use/look at. I will update this post once SimplePass is live.
